# Wasl - WhatsApp-like Chat App

## Project Overview
Building "Wasl" - a WhatsApp-like real-time chat application using Next.js 16, Prisma (SQLite), and Socket.io mini service.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 App Router, single `/` route (auth screen + chat interface)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io mini service on port 3003 (XTransformPort routing via Caddy)
- **Database**: Prisma + SQLite at `db/custom.db`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui, WhatsApp green theme, light/dark mode via next-themes

## Important Infrastructure Notes (for future agents)
- **The sandbox's persistent shell does NOT keep background processes alive between tool calls.** Plain `&` / `nohup` / `setsid` (without `-f`) all die when the parent bash exits. The reliable pattern is `setsid -f bash -c '...' < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1` — this performs a proper double-fork detach and the process survives across tool calls and HTTP requests.
- Both services must be running for the app to work:
  - Chat service: `cd /home/z/my-project/mini-services/chat-service && setsid -f bash -c 'exec bun --hot index.ts > /tmp/wasl-chat-service.log 2>&1' < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1`
  - Dev server: `cd /home/z/my-project && setsid -f bash -c 'exec ./node_modules/.bin/next dev -p 3000 > /home/z/my-project/dev.log 2>&1' < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1`
- Logs: `/home/z/my-project/dev.log` (Next.js) and `/tmp/wasl-chat-service.log` (socket.io).
- The schema uses `prisma db push` (`bun run db:push`) — no migrations folder needed.

## Current Status (Phase 1 — COMPLETE)
Phase 1 MVP is fully working and verified end-to-end with agent-browser.

## Current Status (Phase 2 — COMPLETE)
Phase 2 adds: the Cirkle-inspired **animated Wasl logo + favicon**, the **Commit feature** (AI-verified agreements imported from the Cirkle repo at github.com/fortleem/CIRKLE), and fixes the demo-login bug. All verified end-to-end with agent-browser.

## Completed
- Prisma schema: `User`, `Conversation`, `Participant`, `Message` (with reply, status, type)
- Socket.io mini service on port 3003:
  - User identify + presence (online/offline) broadcast
  - Conversation room join/leave
  - `message:send` → broadcast `message:received` to room + `conversation:updated` globally
  - `message:status` (delivered/read) broadcast
  - `typing:start` / `typing:stop` + auto-timeout cleaner
  - `conversation:upserted` for new-chats notifications
- REST API (Next.js Route Handlers, `runtime = nodejs`):
  - `POST /api/auth/signup`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me` — cookie session via `wasl_session`
  - `GET/POST /api/conversations` — list (with last message preview + unread count), create (1-on-1 dedup + group)
  - `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/conversations/[id]` — details, rename group, leave/delete
  - `GET/POST/PATCH /api/conversations/[id]/messages` — paginated history (marks read on fetch), send (text/image/reply), mark delivered/read
  - `GET /api/users/search?q=` — search by name or phone
  - `PATCH /api/profile`, `POST /api/profile` — update profile, set presence
  - `POST /api/seed` — seed demo contacts + a 1-on-1 chat (with sample messages) + a group
- Frontend (`src/components/wasl/`):
  - `auth-screen.tsx` — Wasl-branded hero banner + signup/login form + demo credentials button
  - `chat-app.tsx` — main container, bootstraps user, socket listeners, presence heartbeat, mobile view derivation
  - `sidebar.tsx` — chat list with search, filter tabs (All/Unread/Groups), conversation rows with avatars/last message/unread badges/online status, profile footer
  - `chat-window.tsx` — header (avatar, last-seen, call/search/menu actions), messages with date dividers + reply previews, infinite-scroll-up history, typing indicator, message status ticks (sent/delivered/read)
  - `message-bubble.tsx` — WhatsApp-style bubbles (green out / white in) with tails, system bubbles for group events
  - `message-input.tsx` — auto-resize textarea, emoji picker, image attach, reply banner, send/mic button, typing emit
  - `contact-info-panel.tsx` — right-side info panel (hero, about, phone, members for groups, shared media, actions)
  - `new-chat-dialog.tsx` — search users + toggle single/group mode + group name
  - `settings-dialog.tsx` — edit name/about, theme toggle, seed demo data
  - `emoji-picker.tsx` — categorized emoji picker popover
  - `wasl-avatar.tsx` — colored avatar with initials, online status dot
  - `theme-provider.tsx` — next-themes wrapper
- Styling (`src/app/globals.css`):
  - WhatsApp signature palette (green/teal) for light + dark mode
  - Chat background doodle pattern
  - Bubble tails, typing dots animation, date divider pills, fade-in animation
  - Custom thin scrollbar
- `lib/`:
  - `auth.ts` (cookie session), `db.ts` (prisma client), `socket.ts` (socket.io singleton), `store.ts` (zustand store), `time.ts` (formatters), `avatar.ts` (colors/initials)
- Lint passes with 0 errors / 0 warnings.

## Verification (agent-browser)
- Auth screen renders, "Use demo credentials" pre-fills, Sign up → chat UI
- Settings → "Add demo contacts" seeds 8 demo users + 1-on-1 chat + group chat
- Conversation list shows avatars, last message, timestamps, unread badges
- Clicking a conversation opens it; messages load with date dividers
- Sending a text+emoji message works; status ticks show; sidebar preview updates
- Dark mode toggle works (`document.documentElement.className === "dark"`)
- New chat dialog searches users by name (returns "Amira Hassan")
- Group chat shows system bubble "Demo User created the group..." and sender name on messages
- Mobile viewport (375x720): single-pane view with back button → returns to list
- Browser console: no runtime errors
- All API routes return 200 in dev log

## Unresolved / Next-Phase Priorities
1. **Real multi-user presence**: cross-session presence works but we have no second logged-in browser in this single-session test. Consider a "demo companion bot" that posts a random reply so single-user testing feels alive.
2. **Image attachment UX**: currently stores data URL in DB (capped ~1.5MB). Consider file-based storage for larger images.
3. **Voice messages**: mic button is currently disabled — implement MediaRecorder + upload.
4. **Unread badge update after sending**: when a message is sent, the conversation row should bump its preview/last-message time (it does update locally; verify socket broadcast refreshes other clients).
5. **Search within a conversation**: search button currently opens contact info; add in-chat message search.
6. **Notifications**: desktop notifications when tab is in the background.
7. **PWA / installability** for mobile. (Manifest + icons are already wired up in Phase 2.)
8. **Scroll-to-bottom button** when scrolled up in long chats.
9. **Message reactions / starred messages / pin**.
10. **Group admin actions** (add/remove members, change group photo).
11. **End-to-end style polish**: more spacing refinements, hover effects, animations.
12. **Commit escrow + jury/mediation + recurring + NFT mint**: the Cirkle commit feature has many more sub-features (escrow, jury voting, recurring schedules, NFT minting, templates). Phase 2 implemented the core (create/sign/complete + hash + fairness). Extend if needed.
13. **Commit in group chats**: currently the composer commit button only shows for 1-on-1 chats. Extend to group commits with multi-party signatures.
14. **AI auto-detect commit**: the Cirkle chat-commit sheet auto-detects commit type from message text. Add an "AI detect" button that pre-fills the form from the last N messages.

Task ID: 2
Agent: main (phase-2)
Task: Implement the Cirkle-inspired Commit feature in Wasl, add the animated Wasl logo + favicon (brand imported from github.com/fortleem/CIRKLE), and fix the demo-login bug.

Work Log:
- Cloned the Cirkle repo (github.com/fortleem/CIRKLE) and studied its brand + commit feature:
  - `src/components/brand/circle-logo.tsx` (golden ring + quadrant icons, `animate-orb-float`)
  - `src/app/api/commit/route.ts` (CommitType: price|work|service|rental|group_buy; fairness check; hash; escrow)
  - `src/components/overlays/cirkle-commit.tsx` + `chat-commit.tsx` (commit-in-chat flow)
- Created the Wasl animated logo:
  - `src/components/wasl/wasl-logo.tsx` — React `WaslLogo` (whatsapp green→teal ring + chat bubble with 3 pulsing typing dots; `animated`, `withWordmark`, `monochrome` props) + `WaslLogoFavicon` static SVG.
  - `public/wasl-favicon.svg` — static SVG favicon (green ring + chat bubble on dark bg).
  - `public/logo.svg` — replaced the old Z.ai breathe logo with the animated Wasl SVG (breathe + dot pulse keyframes inline; respects `prefers-reduced-motion`).
  - `src/app/manifest.ts` — PWA manifest (name, theme_color #075e54, icons, standalone display).
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` — wired `icons` (svg+xml) + `manifest` + `appleWebApp` metadata; title "Wasl — Simple. Secure. Connected."
  - CSS in `globals.css`: `wasl-logo-float`, `wasl-logo-breathe`, `wasl-logo-dot` keyframes + `wasl-text-gradient` wordmark + reduced-motion guard.
- Replaced the static `MessageCircle` icon on the auth screen, sidebar header, sidebar empty state, and chat-window empty state with the animated `WaslLogo`.
- Fixed the demo-login bug:
  - `src/components/wasl/auth-screen.tsx` — extracted `authenticate()` so the "Try the live demo" button calls it directly with demo credentials + signup mode (instead of only pre-filling the form). Renamed button to "Try the live demo". The form submit and the demo button both call the same path, then `router.refresh()` swaps the server-rendered AuthScreen for ChatApp via the new session cookie.
- Added the Cirkle-inspired Commit feature:
  - Prisma: new `Commit` model (id, conversationId, creatorId, counterpartyId, type, title, description, amount, currency, deadline, conditions JSON, status, fairnessScore, fairnessNote, hash, creatorSigned, counterpartySigned, *At timestamps, completedAt) + `Message.commitId` link; back-relations on User + Conversation; pushed to DB.
  - `src/lib/commit.ts` — `COMMIT_TYPES` (5 types w/ emoji), `COMMIT_CURRENCIES`, `genHash()` (64-char hex), `fairnessCheck()` (70-97 score + market range note), `serializeCommit()`.
  - API routes:
    - `POST /api/commits` — create + auto-sign by creator + post a `type='commit'` message in the conversation
    - `GET /api/commits?conversationId=` — list commits for a conversation (members only)
    - `GET /api/commits/[id]` — single commit
    - `POST /api/commits/[id]/sign` — counterparty signs; transitions pending→active when both signed
    - `POST /api/commits/[id]/complete` — either party marks active→completed
  - `src/app/api/conversations/[id]/messages/route.ts` — GET + POST now return `commitId` so the frontend can render commit cards.
  - Socket.io mini service: added `commit:updated` relay so other clients refresh commit cards in real time when a party signs/completes.
  - Store: added `Commit` type, `commitsByConversation`, `setCommits`, `upsertCommit`.
  - UI components:
    - `src/components/wasl/new-commit-dialog.tsx` — type selector grid (5 emojis), title, description, amount+currency, deadline, conditions list, fairness teaser; broadcasts `message:send` + `commit:updated` after create.
    - `src/components/wasl/commit-card.tsx` — renders inside the chat for `type='commit'` messages; shows emoji+title+type, status pill (pending/active/completed/disputed), amount/deadline/fairness chips, conditions checklist, two-party signature avatars with green check badges, fairness note, copyable hash, and contextual Sign/Mark-completed buttons; fetches its own commit on mount.
    - `src/components/wasl/message-bubble.tsx` — renders `<CommitCard>` for `type='commit'` messages.
    - `src/components/wasl/message-input.tsx` — added a `ShieldCheck` "Create a verified commit" button in the composer toolbar (only for 1-on-1 chats).
    - `src/components/wasl/chat-window.tsx` — loads commits on conversation open, listens for `commit:updated` socket events, renders the NewCommitDialog.
    - `src/components/wasl/contact-info-panel.tsx` — added a "Commits" section listing all agreements for the conversation with status pills.
  - CSS in `globals.css`: `wasl-commit-card` (green gradient), `wasl-commit-status-{pending,active,completed,disputed}` pills.
- Restarted both services (dev server needed to pick up the regenerated Prisma Client that includes the new `Commit` model).

Stage Summary:
- Animated Wasl logo + favicon wired into layout metadata + PWA manifest (all served as image/svg+xml, HTTP 200).
- Demo-login bug fixed: one click on "Try the live demo" now signs up + navigates to the chat UI.
- Cirkle Commit feature fully working end-to-end (verified with agent-browser as two different users):
  - Demo User created a "Used MacBook Air M2 — 500 SAR" price commit → PENDING SIGNATURE card rendered in chat with hash 0x935d…765a70, fairness 76, both parties shown (creator signed).
  - Contact info panel shows a "Commits · 1 agreement" section with the commit.
  - Logged out, logged in as Amira (counterparty) → commit card shows "Sign commit" button → signed → status became ACTIVE → "Mark completed" button appeared → completed → status COMPLETED, "Agreement completed" message.
  - All commit API routes returned 200 (create/list/sign/complete).
  - Lint passes with 0 errors / 0 warnings.
- Both services (dev server :3000, chat-service :3003) running via the `setsid -f` pattern.
